# Regression and model validation #

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*
       
- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods.
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using.


*To conduct data wrangling, I read the full learning2014 data and explored the structur and dimentions of the data by using the following codes.*

## Data wrangling ##
```{r}
lrn14 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

dim(lrn14)

str(lrn14)
```


*To create a dataset for analysis, I first scaled all combination variables. After that, I kept only columns required for anlaysis, excluded unsuitable cases and modified column names by using the following codes.* 

### Scaling variables to the original scales ###

```{r}
lrn14$Attitude / 10
lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10
library(dplyr)

deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")

deep_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(deep_questions))
lrn14$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)

surface_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(surface_questions))
lrn14$surf <- rowMeans(surface_columns)

strategic_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(strategic_questions))
lrn14$stra <- rowMeans(strategic_columns)
```



### Keeping columns needed for analysis ###
```{r}
keep_columns <- c("gender", "Age", "attitude", "deep", "stra", "surf", "Points")
learning2014 <- select(lrn14, one_of(keep_columns))
str(learning2014)
```



### Modifying column names ###
```{r}
colnames(learning2014)[2] <- "age"
colnames(learning2014)[7] <- "points"
learning2014 <- filter(learning2014, points > 0)

str(learning2014)
```


*To fit regression models, I read and explore the data set as follows:*

## Data analysis ##

```{r}
ex2 <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/learning2014.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

### Exploring data ###
```{r}
str(ex2)
dim(ex2)
```


*The structure of the data is as follows: The number of observations is 166 and the number of varaibles is 7.*

*I created plots showing the distributions of the variables and the relationships between them by using the following codes. According to the plot and summary information, "points" is most highly correlated with "attitude", whereas it is least correlated with "deep".*  

### Graphical overview and summaries ###
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
ggplot(ex2)
pairs(ex2[-1])

```

```{r}
p <- ggpairs(ex2, maaping = aes(), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
p
```




```{r}
summary(ex2)
```

*To begin with, I chose "attitude", "stra" and "surf" as explanatory variables and fitted a regression model(model1) with them as follows. However, as the coefficient of surf is not significant and its p-value is too high, I fitted another model(model2) withouth the variable. In model2, attitude and stra have an positive effect on points. The coefficient of attitude is significant at the 0.001% significance level and that of stra is significant at the 10% significance level. Regarding R-squrare, model2's adjusted R-square is 0.1951, which is a bit higher than model1's one accounting for 0.1927.*

### Fitting regression models ###
### explanatory variables: attitude, stra, surf
```{r}
model1 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = ex2)
summary(model1)
model2 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra, data = ex2)
summary(model2)
```


*I created diagnostic plots including Residuals vs Fitted values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage as follows:*
### Producing diagnostic plots ###
#### Residuals vs Fitted Values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage ####

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model2, which = c(1,2,5))
plot(model2)
```
